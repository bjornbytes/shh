SHH ðŸ¤«
===

SHH (**S**pherical **H**armonics **H**elpers) is a Lua/[LÃ–VR](https://lovr.org) library for
computing spherical harmonics and using them for lighting.  It uses compute shaders to generate
spherical harmonics on the GPU at realtime speeds.

Spherical What Now?

Spherical harmonics basically store a "ball of light" using some fancy math and a very small amount
of data.  They're similar to a skybox, but more blurry and only take up about 100 bytes!  They're a
quick, cheap way to add soft diffuse lighting to objects so they look like they belong in a scene.

[Here](https://martinoshelf.neocities.org/spherical-harmonics-lovr) is a blog post that goes into
more of the math behind spherical harmonics, with great diagrams and sample code!

Example
---

```lua
local shh = require 'shh'

function lovr.load()
  skybox = lovr.graphics.newTexture('sky.hdr', {
    usage = { 'storage', 'sample' }
  })

  SH = shh.new(skybox)

  model = lovr.graphics.newModel('armordillo.glb')
end

function lovr.draw(pass)
  pass:skybox(skybox)
  shh.setShader(pass, SH)
  pass:draw(model)
end
```

Usage
---

First, copy the `shh.lua` file to your project and require it.

To create a new spherical harmonics object, use `SH = shh.new(arg)`.  The argument can be:

- `nil` - Create an empty object (all coefficients will be zero).
- `table` - A table of 27 numbers or a table of 9 tables (each with 3 numbers) containing the raw
  coefficients.
- `Texture` - A Texture to compute the coefficients from.  It can be a cubemap texture or an
  equirectangular texture (2d spherical image with 2:1 aspect ratio).

A SH object is simply a table of 9 basis vectors, so you can access `SH[x][y]` to get the raw
coefficient values (where x is 1-9 and y is 1-3).

Spherical harmonics objects have the following methods:

- `SH:evaluate(dx, dy, dz)` - Get the color at a given direction.  The direction can 3 numbers or a
  `vec3` object, and should be normalized.  This basically blends all the coefficients together
  based on the direction to get a final color value.
- `SH:addAmbientLight(r, g, b)` - Add an ambient light to the coefficients.  This will be added to
  any existing light in the SH object.
- `SH:addDirectionalLight(dx, dy, dz, r, g, b)` - Add a directional light to the coefficients.  This
  will be added to any existing light in the SH object.  The direction vector should be the
  direction *towards* the light.  Note that due to math reasons, a small amount of light will "leak"
  in the opposite direction of the light.
- `SH:add(other)` - Add another spherical harmonics object to this one, essentially summing their
  light together.
- `SH:lerp(other, t)` - Blend this spherical harmonics object with another one.  `t` is a value from
  zero to one, where 0 will keep `SH` the same and 1 will set `SH` equal to `other`.
- `SH:scale(x)` - Multiply all coefficients by `x`, which will have brightening/darkening effect.

Lighting
---

There are a few ways to use spherical harmonics for lighting.

SHH provides a convenience function `shh.setShader(pass, SH)` which will set a shader on `pass` that
will light objects using the `SH` object.

However, spherical harmonics lighting can be integrated into your own shaders and combined with
direct lighting, PBR materials, etc.  To make this easier, SHH has a `shader.glsl` file that can be
included in custom shaders.  It defines an `evaluateSH` function that takes a spherical harmonics
basis and a direction vector, and returns a color:

```glsl
#include "shh/shader.glsl"

layout(set = 2, binding = 0) uniform SH { vec3 sh[9]; };

vec4 lovrmain() {
  vec3 color = evaluateSH(sh, normalize(Normal)) / PI;
  return vec4(color, 1.);
}
```

**Note** that when doing lighting, you probably want to divide the result from `evaluateSH` by `PI`.
This applies the Lambertian BRDF which gets the values in a more appropriate range.

Advanced Compute Shader API
---

To generate spherical harmonics from a Texture using a compute shader, use `shh.compute`:

```lua
shh.compute(pass, texture, buffer, bufferOffset)
```

Example:

```lua
local pass = lovr.graphics.newPass()
local skybox = lovr.graphics.newTexture('skybox.hdr', { usage = 'storage' })
local buffer = lovr.graphics.newBuffer('vec4', 9)
shh.compute(pass, skybox, buffer)
lovr.graphics.submit(pass)
SH = shh.new(buffer:getData())

-- or, compute SH dynamically every frame:
function lovr.draw(pass)
  shh.compute(pass, skybox, buffer)
  shh.setShader(pass, buffer)
  pass:draw(model)
end
```

This is a lower-level method that will run a compute shader on `pass` that computes spherical
harmonics coefficients from `texture` and writes them to `buffer` (at offset `bufferOffset`, which
defaults to zero).  It can be used to compute spherical harmonics for many textures on the GPU in
parallel.

Like `shh.new`, the texture should be a cubemap or an equirectangular texture.  It must have the
`storage` usage.  Currently its format must be `rgba8`, `rgba16f`, `rgba32f`, or `rg11b10f`.

> Tip: You can pass a texture view to this function to compute spherical harmonics from a smaller
> mipmap level of a cubemap.  This usually gives roughly the same results but is much faster.

The buffer should use the `vec4` format or the `vec3` format with the `std140` layout.  144 bytes
will be written to the buffer.

The buffer can be used directly in a shader, or, after submitting the pass, the coefficients can be
read back to the CPU using `Buffer:getData`.  Sending the buffer directly to a shader will avoid any
costly readbacks and keep all the data on the GPU.
